# OS Operations Simulation

This project is a simple attempt to simulate basic operating system operations.


## Purpose

The goal is to understand how operating system mechanisms like system calls and context switches work at a low level, and how much overhead they introduce. I will try also to organize the repo as possible.


# NOTES ABOUT THE REPO
It's a personal notes and my efforts to understand OS concepts.
to be continued..
